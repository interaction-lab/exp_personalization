# Toward Personalized Affect-Aware Socially Assistive Robot Tutors in Long-Term Interventions for Children with Autism

To provide further details to ensure reproducibility of the work, we open-sourced our code and created interactive Python notebooks (.ipynb) with line-by-line comments to share the implementation of our experiments for the three session-based modeling methods: 1) individualized modeling (individualized.ipynb); 2) generic modeling (generic.ipynb); and 3) personalized modeling (personalized.ipynb) with supervised domain adaptation (s-DA).
