# Toward Personalized Affect-Aware Socially Assistive Robot Tutors in Long-Term Interventions for Children with Autism

To provide further details to ensure this work can be reproduced by researchers with no machine learning expertise, we open-sourced our code and created notebooks with line-by-line comments to share the implementation of our experiments for the three session-based modeling methods: 1) individualized modeling; 2) generic modeling; and 3) personalized modeling with supervised domain adaptation (s-DA).
